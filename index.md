## My User Guide

### Values

There are some things are intrinsic in my personality:

- **Transparency**: you can expect transparency in our working relationship. I will be honest about expectations and how things are going regardless of our positions. If there are certainties or risks, they will be shared.
- **Work-centered**: I learnt very earlier that I will be working 1/5 or 1/6 of my life, then I must be investing this time and not wasting this time.
- **Trust over control**: if you have good and competent people aligned with your culture, you should _truly_ empower and trust them.
- **Action-orientation**: I will just do it, risk and cost/benefit evaluation are part of my thought process, but I will not avoid doing things because of _comfortability_.
- **Organization**: I work in an organizational way. I have a personal backlog where I put everything that I must do from a professional and personal perspective. I also work with a prioritization matrix driving the urgency and importance of everything that I need to do.

### Commmunication

Usually, more introvert people have challenges when _invading_ someone else's space and prefer asynchronous communication. My preference is always a face to face conversation, but I must say that I am more hesitant to give you a call and I rather send you a text message or even an email before calling you. 

#### Responsiveness

If you have a request, you probably are inside my personal backlog, so I will **always** come back to you. Also, unless I can fufill your request in a timely fashion, I will you give a sense of when it will be done. This is really nice, but I also expect this from my colleagues. 

Please, don't share the __too busy__ argument with me.  
	
### What gives me energy?

- **Efficiency**: as soon as I am effective in something, I start thinking how it can be more efficient. This is also a source of many battles (from a positive perspective) that I will pick up. You probably can relate to that if you like to automate everything.


### What drains my energy?

- **Politics**: let's get it done. I have seen many people concerned about everything but the company mission, vision and customers: their jobs, their roles, their power, their department and etc. I can play games very well, but they require a huge amount of energy from me. Let me invest this energy is something else.
